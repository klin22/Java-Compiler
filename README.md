This repository contains a toy language implementation in Java. The core source files live in project, including:

Lexer.java: Converts raw text into tokens.
Parser.java: Builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) from tokens.
Analyzer.java: Performs semantic checks and type analysis on the AST.
Additional examples appear in examples, and homework tasks in homework.

Test files are located in project and mirror the main folder structure, providing coverage for each component. Use your preferred build or test runner to compile and run the code.
